# MultiversX SDK for Front-End DApps

MultiversX Front-End SDK for JavaScript and TypeScript (written in TypeScript).

## Introduction

`sdk-dapp-core` is a library that holds core functional logic that can be used to create a dApp on MultiversX Network.

It is built for applications that use any of the following technologies:
- React
- Angular
- Vue
- Any other JavaScript framework (e.g. Solid.js etc.)
- React Native
- Next.js

## GitHub project
The GitHub repository can be found here: [https://github.com/multiversx/mx-sdk-dapp-core](https://github.com/multiversx/mx-sdk-dapp-core)

## Live demo: template-dapp
See [Dapp template](https://template-dapp.multiversx.com/) for live demo or checkout usage in the [Github repo](https://github.com/multiversx/mx-template-dapp)


## Requirements
- Node.js version 20.13.1+
- Npm version 10.5.2+

## Distribution

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@multiversx/sdk-dapp)

## Installation

The library can be installed via npm or yarn.

```bash
npm install @multiversx/sdk-dapp-core
```

or

```bash
yarn add @multiversx/sdk-dapp-core
```

If you need only the core logic, without the additional UI, you can create a project-specific `.npmrc` file to configure per-package installation behavior. This will skip the installation of `@multiversx/sdk-dapp-core-ui`, but keep in mind that you may need to provide the UI components yourself.

```bash
## .npmrc
@multiversx/sdk-dapp-core:omit-optional=true
## ebable the option when needed with: 
## @multiversx/sdk-dapp-core:omit-optional=false

##Run Installation When you run npm install, NPM will use the configurations specified in the .npmrc file:
npm install
```

If you're transitioning from @multiversx/sdk-dapp, you can check out the [Migration guide PR](https://github.com/multiversx/mx-template-dapp/pull/264) of Template Dapp

## Project structure

When inspectig the package, you will find multiple folders under `src`, but the ones of intereset are:

```bash
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ apiCalls/ ### methods for interacting with the API
â”œâ”€â”€ constants/ ### useful constants from the ecosystem like ledger error codes, default gas limits for transactions etc.
â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/ ### business logic for UI elements like transactions and amount formatting
â”œâ”€â”€ core/ ### hosting provider the class, and all implementations for different signing providers
â””â”€â”€ store/ ### sore initialization, middleware, slices, selectors and actions
```

Since the project is developed as a universal solution for any Front-End dApp, it has 3 main parts: 
- First is the business logic in `apiCalls`, `constants` and `core` (signing providers). 
- Then comes the persistence layer hosted in the `store` folder, using [Zustand](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/) under the hood.
- Last are the UI components hosted in [@multiversx/sdk-dapp-core](https://github.com/multiversx/mx-sdk-dapp-core-ui) with some components controlled on demand by classes defined in `controlles`

These parts hold together different classes and functions that help put a dApp together:

| # | Step | Description |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | Configuration | -  storage configuration (e.g. sessionStorage, localStorage etc.)<br>-  chain configuration<br>-  custom provider configuration (adding / disabling / changing providers) |
| 2 | Provider interaction | -  logging in and out<br>-  siging transactions / messages |
| 3 | Transactions | -  sending transactions<br>-  tracking transactions |
| 4 | Presenting data | -  get store data (e.g. account balance, account address etc.)<br>-  use components to display data (e.g. balance, address, transactions list) |

Each of these steps will be explained in more detail in the following sections.

## Usage

sdk-dapp-core aims to abstract and simplify the process of interacting with users' wallets and with the MultiversX blockchain, allowing developers to easily get started with new applications.

```
What we have detailed in the Project Structure chapter hold together different parts that help put toghether the following components:

| # | Type | Description |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | Network | Chain configuration |
| 2 | Provider | The signing provider for logging in and singing transactions |
| 3 | Account | Inspecting public key and balance |
| 4 | Transactions Manager | Sending and tracking transactions |
| 5 | Components | Displaying UI information like balance, public keys etc. |

Conceptually, you could see building a dApp in the following way:
















We will describe them one by one and see what they consist of.

### 1. Network configuration





## Debugging your dApp

Use lerna or

In your project, make sure to use the `preserveSymlinks` option in the server configuration to ensure that the symlinks are preserved, for ease of development.

``` js
  resolve: {
    preserveSymlinks: true, // ðŸ‘ˆ
    alias: {
      src: "/src",
    },
  },
```

// TODO: DEMONSTRATE init app


```mermaid
flowchart TB;
    id1{index.tsx} 
    
    -- sdk-dpp-core config --> 
    
    F(
        persistance
        network
        custom providers
    )
        
    -- await config --> 
    
    id2{/unlock}  
    
    -- user presses login --> 
    
    Provider.login

    /dashboard
```
